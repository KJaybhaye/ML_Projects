# ML_Projects

### Computer Vision : Traffic_Light_Detection_With_FasterRCNN
Detecting traffic lights in street photos and classifying them as red, yellow and green.

### NLP : Machine_Translation_With_Transformer
Using a Transformer architecture to translate sentences from one language to another.

### NLP : Sentiment_Analysis_With_BERT 
Training a model to classify movie reviews as positive and negative using BERT as backbone.

### Time Series Forecasting : Crypto_Return_Forecasting_With_LightGBM
Forecasting return value for various crypto currencies.

### RAG_Based_LLM_Agent
A simple LLM agent using LangGraph, CromaDB vector store, Gemini model and LangChain tools.  
The agent talks to the user about Mangas, based on information queries vector store to get matching manga titles to recommend. It can also search Wikipedia to give more information about the manga.
